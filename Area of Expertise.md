The secondary ticket market is often referred to in both a highly positive and negative light, often through the lens of whether you are the one using it to your advantages or paying through the nose. The majority of this marketplace is conducted online through sites such as StubHub and SeatGeek. 

As the big ticket originators, such as Ticketmaster and lately StubHub (with agreements with the likes of Major League Baseball) see further revenue potential slip away, they have worked to capture this market with things like paperless tickets and their own secondary marketplaces to keep these transactions ‘in house’. Ticketmaster’s TM+ for the NFL, and as well as Live Nation Concerts. Paperless tickets function so that when someone buys a ticket from TicketMaster with a credit card, the same card must be used when being retrieved at the box office. This limits resellers and the original buyers in that the card holder must be present, not the person the ticket was bought for.

The scalping market exists as an ad-hoc marketplace on the fringes of the approximately $15b secondary ticket market. It is largely unregulated and represents a classic marketplace. The scalpers control the pricing function of the marketplace as well as supply side information. The buyers seek to obtain a commodity with a limited shelf life with out knowledge of supply and limited pricing information. 

Both sellers and buyers have the additional disadvantage of limited means to find each other and therefore find the best outcome to their respective scenarios. The resulting situation is a middleman to facilitate these transactions.

There is no federal legislation on scalping. Subsequent local and state laws to control and regulate this market have led to buffer zones in regard to venue location, when and where tickets can be exchanged and in some cases, the price. Therefore, what constitutes scalping is often a gray area, tickets sold on one corner are legal while on the next considered illegal. 

The latest wrinkle is one of artists most devoted fans not getting tickets to shows. Realizing how much money they are leaving on the table the artists are becoming more involved. Eric Church, Adele and Louis C.K. have fought well known public battles against scalpers. American Express and others have reserved amounts of often the best tickets which can often end up in the secondary market. 

Every season offers new contentious arguments on the subject with law makers threatening new legislation, ticket originators seeking new ways to maintain control on the secondary market to capture those profits, to fans and artists in some cases working to control these transactions from beginning to end. Every advancement in technology leads to new tools for both scalpers and fans continuing this fight and millions of dollars to be made and lost.
